Face Mask Detector: Step-by-Step Guide
This document provides a step-by-step implementation guide to set up and run the Face Mask Detector project.

1. Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

Python 3.8 or higher
Git installed
Visual Studio Code (VSCode) or another IDE
Git Bash or Command Prompt
A working internet connection
2. Setup Instructions
Step 1: Clone the Repository
Open your terminal (Git Bash or CMD) and run:

bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Live-based-mask-detection.git
cd Live-based-mask-detection/Face_Mask_Detector

Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment
Run the following commands to set up a virtual environment:

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate   # For Windows

# OR

source venv/bin/activate       # For macOS/Linux
Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Step 4: Download Pre-trained Models (if applicable)
If the project uses pre-trained models, ensure they are downloaded:

Place the model files in the models directory, as mentioned in the project.
3. Running the Code

Step 1: Training the Model
If the model needs training, execute:

bash
python train_model.py

Step 2: Testing or Running the Detection
To run the detection on a live camera feed or test images:

bash
python detect_mask.py
4. Folder Structure
Ensure your project folder is organized as follows:

css
Copy code
Live-based-mask-detection/
├── Face_Mask_Detector/
│   ├── models/
│   ├── data/
│   ├── train_model.py
│   ├── detect_mask.py
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── instructions.md


5. Troubleshooting
Issue: ModuleNotFoundError
Solution: Check if all dependencies are installed using pip list.
Issue: Environment not activating
Solution: Ensure you are in the correct directory and rerun the activation command.
