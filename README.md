# Face_Mask_Identifier
This project aims to detect whether a person is wearing a face mask or not using deep learning techniques. The system employs real-time face detection and mask detection powered by a pre-trained deep learning model. The application uses OpenCV for video stream processing and the Keras library for mask classification.
